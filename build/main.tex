\section{Backgrounds}
\subsection{Antenna efficiency}
\subsection{Human body ACS}
basic knowledge of fat content
link between ACS and fat percentage
document study

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Antenna efficiency measurement}


models of time constant
s21, power balance model, chamber time constant
problems of linear curvefitting, fitting range VS final results given by the optimizer
montecarlo method of evaluating accuracy, histogram of Q factor
with and without frequency stirring, whats the difference ?
how to calculate
the uncertainty of antenna efficiency (whats the relation to independent number
of variables, and the k factor)?
how big the frequency step size should be used?
theory of nonlinear curve fitting
sweep times effect on the k factor


\subsection{Human body ACS measurement}
Relative equations, FD method
diagrams of power flow, power balance model
tissue dielectric properties
human body models(analytical(slab, cylinder, sphere))
patching model
numerical models(fdtd mom)
the cst simulation of ACS
effort of shorting measurement times.
segmented sweeping(what is the best setup, experimental study)
GA study of sphere and unclear malfunction of RC above 15 GHz.
The GA fit result(not very stable when it goes to complex shape)
penetration of microwave into tissues
reverse problem( calculate the dielectric property with borns iteration)
the 2d method of moments.

evaluation of accelerated measurement method.
independent number of samples can be collected. uncertanty
